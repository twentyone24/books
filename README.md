## Installation

Download and install the latest release for your platform from the [releases
page](https://github.com/frappe/books/releases) or the [download
page](https://frappebooks.com/download).

## Development

Frappe Books is built on Vue.js and Electron. It is offline by default and uses
a local SQLite file as the database.

### Pre-requisites

To get the dev environment up and running you need to first set up Node.js version
16.13.1 and npm. For this, we suggest using
[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

Next, you will need to install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable).

### Clone and Run

Once you are through the Pre-requisites, you can run the following commands to
setup Frappe Books for development and building:

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/frappe/books.git

# change directory
cd books

# install dependencies
yarn
```

#### Development

To run Frappe Books in development mode (with hot reload, etc):

```bash
# start the electron app
yarn electron:serve
```

#### Build

To build Frappe Books and create an installer:

```bash
# start the electron app
yarn electron:build
```

**Note**
By default the above command will build for your computer's operating system and
architecture. To build for other environments (example: for linux from a windows
computer) check the _Building_ section at
[electron.build/cli](https://www.electron.build/cli).

So to build for linux you could use the `--linux` flag like so: `yarn electron:build --linux`.
